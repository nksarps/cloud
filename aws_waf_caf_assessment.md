# Cloud Migration Assessment: Two-Tier Web Application

**Lab:** Design and Evaluate an AWS Solution Using the Well-Architected and Cloud Adoption Frameworks  
**Author:** Nana Kwaku Sarpong


## Executive Summary

This report assesses the migration of a two-tier web application from on-premises servers to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The evaluation is structured around the AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). The analysis identifies critical risks in the existing architecture, including single points of failure, inadequate security posture, and lack of operational visibility. A target architecture is proposed to address these weaknesses, leveraging AWS managed services to achieve a design that is secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-optimized. This new design aligns with AWS best practices and prepares the organization for a successful cloud transformation.


## Review of the Existing Architecture

The current workload is a traditional two-tier web application hosted entirely on-premises. The architecture is composed of two primary components: a frontend web server and a backend database server. The web server, which runs on a single physical machine, is responsible for hosting the application logic and serving user requests. The database server, also running on a dedicated physical machine, manages all application data. Network connectivity between the servers and external users is facilitated by a basic router and firewall configuration.

This architecture, while functional, carries significant technical debt and operational risk. A review of its components and configuration reveals several critical weaknesses:

- **No High Availability:** Both the web and database tiers are configured as single instances. A hardware failure, operating system crash, or even routine maintenance on either server would result in complete application downtime.
- **Disaster Recovery Vulnerability:** The workload lacks a defined backup strategy. In the event of data corruption, database failure, or a physical disaster such as a fire or flood, all data would be permanently lost with no recovery path.
- **Capacity Constraints:** The physical servers have fixed hardware limits. Scaling to accommodate traffic spikes or business growth requires a lengthy procurement and installation process. This leads to a choice between expensive over-provisioning or poor application performance during peak demand.
- **Weak Security Posture:** The environment lacks defense in depth. The flat network design and permissive firewall rules create a significant risk; if the web server were compromised, an attacker would have direct access to the database. Furthermore, patch management and vulnerability remediation are manual, inconsistent processes.
- **High Operational Overhead:** The IT team is burdened with "undifferentiated heavy lifting," including hardware maintenance, manual software patching, and physical troubleshooting. This diverts focus from developing and improving the application itself.


## Evaluation of the Workload Using the AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF)

| Pillar | Observation (Strength and Weakness) | Improvement Recommendation | Supporting AWS Service & How It Helps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Excellence** | **Strength:** The application has been running stably in production, indicating that the operations team has developed effective runbooks and institutional knowledge over time. <br><br> **Weakness:** Operations are entirely manual (patching, deployment). No centralized logging or monitoring makes it difficult to understand system health and performance proactively. | **Recommendation:** Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent deployments. Use a centralized logging and monitoring solution to gain operational insights and automate responses to events. | **AWS CloudFormation:** Automates and codifies infrastructure deployment, ensuring consistent and repeatable environments. <br> **Amazon CloudWatch:** Provides centralized metrics and log aggregation to monitor application health and performance. <br> **AWS CloudTrail:** Records all API calls for auditing, security analysis, and operational troubleshooting. <br> **AWS Systems Manager:** Automates patching and configuration management across EC2 instances. |
| **Security** | **Strength:** The existing on-premises environment benefits from physical security controls and a traditional network perimeter firewall, providing a basic level of protection. <br><br> **Weakness:** The architecture lacks defense in depth. The database is likely accessible from the web server without strict network controls. No encryption at rest or in transit is mentioned. | **Recommendation:** Implement strict security groups (stateful firewalls) to allow traffic only on necessary ports between tiers. Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit. Use AWS WAF to protect the web application from common exploits. | **Security Groups:** Act as virtual firewalls at the instance level to control inbound and outbound traffic, enabling micro-segmentation between web and database tiers. <br> **AWS WAF:** Protects the web application from common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS) by filtering malicious traffic at the load balancer. <br> **AWS KMS:** Manages encryption keys, allowing easy enablement of data encryption at rest for EBS volumes and RDS databases. <br> **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** Provisions and manages SSL/TLS certificates to easily enable encryption in transit. |
| **Reliability** | **Strength:** The application's components are well-understood and have demonstrated predictable performance under normal load conditions in the on-premises environment. <br><br> **Weakness:** Single-server deployment creates a critical single point of failure. No automated recovery or backup strategy exists. | **Recommendation:** Deploy the web and database tiers across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. Automate recovery using Auto Scaling. Implement automated, tested backups for the database. | **Elastic Load Balancing (ALB):** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers in different AZs, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. <br> **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:** Automatically replaces unhealthy instances and adjusts capacity to maintain desired performance and availability. <br> **Amazon RDS Multi-AZ:** Provides automatic failover to a standby database in a different AZ, eliminating the database as a single point of failure. <br> **AWS Backup:** Centralizes and automates backup policies for RDS and EBS, ensuring recoverability. |
| **Performance Efficiency** | **Strength:** The architecture is simple and straightforward, with no unnecessary complexity that could introduce performance bottlenecks. <br><br> **Weakness:** Fixed hardware capacity cannot adapt to changing demand, leading to either over-provisioning or performance bottlenecks during peak traffic periods. | **Recommendation:** Use scaling services to match capacity with demand. Consider moving to serverless or managed services that abstract the underlying infrastructure to focus on application performance. | **Application Load Balancer:** Distributes load to optimize resource utilization across the server fleet. <br> **EC2 Auto Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts the number of web servers to match the current load, ensuring consistent performance during traffic spikes. <br> **Amazon RDS:** Allows for easy vertical scaling (changing instance class) and read replicas to offload read traffic, improving database read performance. |
| **Cost Optimization** | **Strength:** The existing on-premises infrastructure has already been paid for, with no ongoing cloud consumption costs. The cost model is predictable. <br><br> **Weakness:** Upfront hardware procurement and ongoing maintenance of idle capacity leads to wasted spend. The model is entirely CAPEX-heavy and does not align with variable demand. | **Recommendation:** Shift to an OPEX model by paying only for consumed resources. Right-size instances based on actual usage and use Auto Scaling to eliminate idle capacity. Leverage managed services to reduce administrative overhead. | **AWS Cost Explorer:** Provides visibility into usage patterns, helping to identify and right-size underutilized resources. <br> **AWS Trusted Advisor:** Offers cost optimization recommendations, such as identifying idle load balancers or underutilized EC2 instances. <br> **EC2 Auto Scaling:** Automatically scales in during low-demand periods, eliminating the cost of idle servers. <br> **Savings Plans:** Offers significant discounts on EC2 and RDS usage in exchange for a consistent commitment, reducing overall compute costs. |


## Application of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

### Business Perspective

The organization demonstrates clear business motivation for migrating to the cloud, primarily driven by the desire to reduce data center operational costs and improve business agility. Leadership recognizes that the current capital expenditure model for hardware procurement is inflexible and that moving to an operational expenditure model could better align technology spending with actual business demand. However, the organization has not yet developed a comprehensive business case that quantifies the expected return on investment or maps specific business outcomes to technical milestones. Without this financial framework, it will be challenging to measure the success of the migration or make informed decisions about resource allocation. Key actions required include establishing a cloud financial management practice to track and optimize spending from day one. The finance and procurement teams must be engaged early to understand the shift from upfront hardware purchases to ongoing consumption-based billing. Additionally, leadership should develop a value realization plan that connects technical achievements, such as successful migration of the database tier, to tangible business benefits like faster feature delivery and reduced unplanned downtime. This business alignment will ensure that the cloud transformation delivers measurable value rather than becoming a costly infrastructure refresh.

### People Perspective

The IT staff possesses deep institutional knowledge of the existing application and has maintained its stable operation over many years. This expertise is invaluable and must be preserved throughout the migration process. However, the team's skill set is currently centered on managing physical infrastructure, with limited exposure to cloud-native services and modern operational practices. There is an understandable comfort with existing workflows, which may create resistance to the changes that cloud adoption will bring. The organization must invest in a comprehensive upskilling program tailored to different roles within the team. Developers will need to learn how to build with AWS services, operations staff must understand cloud monitoring and automation, and security personnel require education on the Shared Responsibility Model. Beyond formal training, the organization should foster a culture that encourages experimentation and rewards learning. Identifying and empowering internal "cloud champions" who can mentor peers and advocate for new approaches will accelerate adoption. The human element of this transformation is often the most challenging, and proactive change management will be essential to building a cloud-ready culture.

### Governance Perspective

The organization's existing governance model relies heavily on manual controls, change advisory boards, and lengthy approval processes designed for a static on-premises environment. While this approach has provided stability, it will become a bottleneck in the cloud, where infrastructure can be provisioned in minutes and agility is a primary benefit. There are currently no established policies for cloud resource provisioning, tagging standards, or compliance monitoring. Without these foundational elements, the organization risks uncontrolled spending, security vulnerabilities, and difficulty tracking resources by cost center or environment. To address this, the organization must implement a strong identity foundation using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with least-privilege access principles. A comprehensive tagging strategy should be developed to enable cost allocation, environment identification, and operational management. As the organization scales its cloud usage, AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs) should be employed to create guardrails that ensure compliance without sacrificing developer velocity. The goal is to shift from restrictive manual controls to automated governance that enables safe innovation within well-defined boundaries. This evolution will require close collaboration between IT, security, and finance teams to define policies that balance control with agility.

### Platform Perspective

The current platform consists of physical servers with fixed capacity, representing a significant limitation in terms of scalability and flexibility. The target platform will be a well-architected AWS environment, but the organization currently lacks a clear blueprint for this new infrastructure. There is an opportunity to build a proper cloud foundation from the outset rather than replicating the existing on-premises architecture in the cloud. The organization should begin by constructing a secure, multi-account landing zone using AWS Control Tower or following AWS best practices for foundational infrastructure. This landing zone will provide a consistent baseline for security, networking, and access controls across all future cloud deployments. Regarding the migration strategy for the two-tier application, a "re-platform" approach is recommended. While the web servers could be re-hosted on EC2 with some modifications, migrating the database to Amazon RDS would offload administrative burden and immediately provide benefits like automated backups, patching, and high availability. All infrastructure should be defined and managed using Infrastructure as Code tools such as AWS CloudFormation or Terraform. This approach ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control for all environment changes, laying the groundwork for future automation and innovation.

### Security Perspective

Security is rightly a top concern for the organization as it considers moving critical applications to the cloud. The team's expertise, however, is concentrated on traditional perimeter-based security models involving firewalls and physical data center controls. There is limited understanding of cloud-specific security concepts, and crucially, the AWS Shared Responsibility Model is not yet fully internalized. This lack of clarity could lead to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, as the organization may not understand which security controls are AWS's responsibility and which fall to the customer. Immediate education on the Shared Responsibility Model is essential to establish a clear understanding of accountabilities. Following this, the organization must implement the security improvements identified in the Well-Architected assessment. This includes configuring security groups to enable micro-segmentation between application tiers, encrypting data both at rest and in transit, and deploying AWS WAF in front of the web application to protect against common exploits. Advanced threat detection should be enabled using Amazon GuardDuty to continuously monitor for malicious activity. Vulnerability management must be automated through services like Amazon Inspector, and patch management should be centralized with AWS Systems Manager. By embedding security into the infrastructure from the start, the organization can achieve a stronger posture than its on-premises environment ever provided.

### Operations Perspective

Current operations are characterized as reactive and "break-fix," with the team responding to incidents as they occur rather than proactively managing system health. There are no established runbooks for cloud-specific scenarios, nor are there defined procedures for performance monitoring in an environment where resources can dynamically scale. This operational model will not suffice in the cloud, where the pace of change is faster and the infrastructure is more dynamic. The organization must fundamentally rethink its approach to operations, shifting from managing individual servers to managing services and applications. Key performance indicators should be defined, including metrics such as mean time to recovery, application availability, and deployment frequency. Amazon CloudWatch should be configured to collect metrics and logs, providing a centralized view of system health and enabling proactive alerting. Cloud-specific runbooks must be developed for common tasks such as scaling the application tier, deploying new versions, and responding to incidents. These runbooks should be regularly tested and refined. Furthermore, the operations team should establish a cadence for reviewing metrics and logs to identify trends and proactively address potential issues before they impact users. This evolution from reactive to proactive operations will be critical to realizing the reliability and performance benefits of the cloud.


## Reflection

Completing this lab helped me understand how to apply AWS frameworks in a structured way. Before this exercise, I knew the names of the Well-Architected pillars and the CAF perspectives, but I did not fully grasp how to use them for actual analysis. Working through the two-tier application example forced me to move beyond definitions and think critically about what each pillar means in practice. For instance, identifying a strength and a weakness for every pillar was more challenging than I expected. It required me to consider the existing architecture from multiple angles rather than just listing problems.

Working through the CAF perspectives gave me a broader view of migration planning. Writing about the Business, People, and Governance perspectives made me realize that successful cloud projects depend on more than just good infrastructure design. Factors like staff training, governance policies, and business case development are equally important and require just as much attention as the technical architecture. This exercise showed me that cloud adoption is an organizational effort, not just an IT project.

Putting together the final architecture description and diagram helped me connect the analysis to a practical outcome. I can see how the recommendations from the WAF assessment directly shaped the design choices, such as using RDS Multi-AZ to address the reliability weakness. Overall, this lab gave me a structured method for evaluating workloads that I can apply in future projects.
