# Cloud Migration Assessment: Two-Tier Web Application

**Lab:** Design and Evaluate an AWS Solution Using the Well-Architected and Cloud Adoption Frameworks  
**Author:** Nana Kwaku Sarpong


## Executive Summary

This report assesses the migration of a two-tier web application from on-premises servers to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The evaluation is structured around the AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). The analysis identifies critical risks in the existing architecture, including single points of failure, inadequate security posture, and lack of operational visibility. A target architecture is proposed to address these weaknesses, leveraging AWS managed services to achieve a design that is secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-optimized. This new design aligns with AWS best practices and prepares the organization for a successful cloud transformation.


## Task 1: Review the Existing Architecture 

The current workload is a traditional two-tier web application hosted entirely on-premises. The architecture is composed of two primary components: a frontend web server and a backend database server. The web server, which runs on a single physical machine, is responsible for hosting the application logic and serving user requests. The database server, also running on a dedicated physical machine, manages all application data. Network connectivity between the servers and external users is facilitated by a basic router and firewall configuration.

This architecture, while functional, carries significant technical debt and operational risk. A review of its components and configuration reveals several critical weaknesses:

- **No High Availability:** Both the web and database tiers are configured as single instances. A hardware failure, operating system crash, or even routine maintenance on either server would result in complete application downtime.
- **Disaster Recovery Vulnerability:** The workload lacks a defined backup strategy. In the event of data corruption, database failure, or a physical disaster such as a fire or flood, all data would be permanently lost with no recovery path.
- **Capacity Constraints:** The physical servers have fixed hardware limits. Scaling to accommodate traffic spikes or business growth requires a lengthy procurement and installation process. This leads to a choice between expensive over-provisioning or poor application performance during peak demand.
- **Weak Security Posture:** The environment lacks defense in depth. The flat network design and permissive firewall rules create a significant risk; if the web server were compromised, an attacker would have direct access to the database. Furthermore, patch management and vulnerability remediation are manual, inconsistent processes.
- **High Operational Overhead:** The IT team is burdened with "undifferentiated heavy lifting," including hardware maintenance, manual software patching, and physical troubleshooting. This diverts focus from developing and improving the application itself.


## Task 2: Evaluate the Workload Using the AWS Well-Architected Framework

| Pillar | Observation (Strength/Weakness) | Improvement Recommendation | Supporting AWS Service & How It Helps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Excellence** | **Weakness:** Operations are manual (patching, deployment). No centralized logging or monitoring makes it difficult to understand system health and performance. | **Recommendation:** Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent deployments. Use a centralized logging and monitoring solution to gain operational insights and automate responses to events. | **AWS CloudFormation:** Automates and codifies infrastructure deployment, ensuring consistent and repeatable environments. <br> **Amazon CloudWatch:** Provides centralized metrics and log aggregation to monitor application health and performance. <br> **AWS CloudTrail:** Records all API calls for auditing, security analysis, and operational troubleshooting. <br> **AWS Systems Manager:** Automates patching and configuration management across EC2 instances. |
| **Security** | **Weakness:** The architecture lacks defense in depth. The database is likely accessible from the web server without strict network controls. No encryption at rest or in transit is mentioned. | **Recommendation:** Implement strict security groups (stateful firewalls) to allow traffic only on necessary ports between tiers. Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit. Use AWS WAF to protect the web application from common exploits. | **Security Groups:** Act as virtual firewalls at the instance level to control inbound and outbound traffic, enabling micro-segmentation between web and database tiers. <br> **AWS WAF:** Protects the web application from common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS) by filtering malicious traffic at the load balancer. <br> **AWS KMS:** Manages encryption keys, allowing easy enablement of data encryption at rest for EBS volumes and RDS databases. <br> **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** Provisions and manages SSL/TLS certificates to easily enable encryption in transit. |
| **Reliability** | **Weakness:** Single-server deployment creates a critical single point of failure. No automated recovery or backup strategy exists. | **Recommendation:** Deploy the web and database tiers across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. Automate recovery using Auto Scaling. Implement automated, tested backups for the database. | **Elastic Load Balancing (ALB):** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers in different AZs, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. <br> **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:** Automatically replaces unhealthy instances and adjusts capacity to maintain desired performance and availability. <br> **Amazon RDS Multi-AZ:** Provides automatic failover to a standby database in a different AZ, eliminating the database as a single point of failure. <br> **AWS Backup:** Centralizes and automates backup policies for RDS and EBS, ensuring recoverability. |
| **Performance Efficiency** | **Weakness:** Fixed hardware capacity cannot adapt to changing demand, leading to either over-provisioning or performance bottlenecks. | **Recommendation:** Use scaling services to match capacity with demand. Consider moving to serverless or managed services that abstract the underlying infrastructure to focus on application performance. | **Application Load Balancer:** Distributes load to optimize resource utilization across the server fleet. <br> **EC2 Auto Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts the number of web servers to match the current load, ensuring consistent performance during traffic spikes. <br> **Amazon RDS:** Allows for easy vertical scaling (changing instance class) and read replicas to offload read traffic, improving database read performance. |
| **Cost Optimization** | **Weakness:** Upfront hardware procurement and ongoing maintenance of idle capacity leads to wasted spend. Model is entirely CAPEX-heavy. | **Recommendation:** Shift to an OPEX model by paying only for consumed resources. Right-size instances based on actual usage and use Auto Scaling to eliminate idle capacity. Leverage managed services to reduce administrative overhead. | **AWS Cost Explorer:** Provides visibility into usage patterns, helping to identify and right-size underutilized resources. <br> **AWS Trusted Advisor:** Offers cost optimization recommendations, such as identifying idle load balancers or underutilized EC2 instances. <br> **EC2 Auto Scaling:** Automatically scales in during low-demand periods, eliminating the cost of idle servers. <br> **Savings Plans:** Offers significant discounts on EC2 and RDS usage in exchange for a consistent commitment, reducing overall compute costs. |
